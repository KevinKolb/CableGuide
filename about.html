        <h1>About Cable Guide</h1>

        <div class="nostalgic">
            <p class="quote">
                "Remember falling asleep in the La-Z-Boy, watching the cable guide scroll by?
                That blue screen with white text, showing you what was on every channel?
                It wasn't just information—it was a destination and a journey."
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Our dads had it good. They'd sit down after dinner, flip to channel 2 or 3, and just <em>watch</em> the guide.
            Sometimes they'd find something interesting. Sometimes they'd just zone out. Either way, it was peaceful.
            Simple. <span class="highlight">It worked.</span>
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem: Too Much Choice</h2>

        <p>
            Today's media landscape is unnavigable. We have Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Apple TV+,
            Peacock, Amazon Prime, and dozens more. Each one has thousands of titles. Infinite scroll. Infinite choice.
            And somehow, we spend 20 minutes browsing before giving up and rewatching <em>The Office</em> again.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's the paradox: <span class="highlight">Everybody wants choice, except that doesn't work when you have all options open.</span>
            Choice paralysis is real. When everything is available, nothing feels special. When you can watch anything,
            you end up watching nothing.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution: Push Media, Not Pull Media</h2>

        <p>
            Remember radio? Not Spotify—<em>real</em> radio. You'd pick a station based on genre: rock, country, jazz, talk.
            Then you'd sit back and let them <span class="highlight">push</span> content to you. The DJ decided what played next.
            You discovered new songs you never would have searched for. No thought necessary. No decision fatigue.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's what Cable Guide brings back. We've repackaged TV in a unique way that feels very familiar.
            It's the old cable guide aesthetic, but with a modern twist. <span class="highlight">We choose for you.</span>
        </p>

        <div class="nostalgic">
            <p>
                <strong>The Cable Guide experience consists of:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Real broadcast channels</strong> with their current, live programming</li>
                <li><strong>Carefully curated "stations"</strong> built from streaming services</li>
                <li><strong>A guide that scrolls</strong>, just like the old days</li>
                <li><strong>No decisions</strong>—just pick a channel and watch what's on</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            We've taken the best shows from Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and Peacock, and organized them
            into themed channels. Want a comedy night? Tune into our comedy station. In the mood for sci-fi? We've got that too.
            <span class="highlight">We've already made the hard choices for you.</span>
        </p>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>

        <div class="nostalgic" style="background: rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.15); border-left-color: #ffd700;">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 19px;">
                Cable Guide is built on five fundamental principles that guide everything we do:
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                1. Constraint Breeds Contentment
            </h3>
            <p>
                Unlimited choice is a curse masquerading as freedom. When you have 10,000 options, you spend more time
                deciding than watching. We impose meaningful constraints—limited channels, curated lineups, scheduled programming.
                <span class="highlight">Scarcity makes things special again.</span>
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                2. Serendipity Over Algorithm
            </h3>
            <p>
                Algorithms give you what you already like. We give you what you didn't know you needed. When you flip to a channel
                and catch a movie halfway through, that's not inefficiency—<span class="highlight">that's discovery.</span>
                The best TV moments are the ones you stumble into, not the ones you queue up.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                3. Push, Don't Pull
            </h3>
            <p>
                Modern streaming makes you work for your entertainment. Search, browse, scroll, decide. We flip it around.
                <span class="highlight">Pick a channel. We'll handle the rest.</span> Like the radio DJs of old, we curate.
                You relax. That's the deal.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                4. Embrace Imperfection
            </h3>
            <p>
                Not every show will be for you. You'll tune in mid-episode sometimes. Shows will end just when you're getting into them.
                <span class="highlight">That's okay.</span> TV was never meant to be perfect—it was meant to be <em>there</em>.
                Background noise. Company. A vibe. Stop optimizing and start watching.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                5. Nostalgia with Purpose
            </h3>
            <p>
                We're not just imitating the past for aesthetic reasons. The old cable guide worked because it solved a real problem:
                <span class="highlight">How do you make TV feel manageable?</span> We bring back the solution, not just the look.
                Retro design meets modern content, all in service of making TV simple again.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>It's a Vibe</h2>

        <p>
            Cable Guide isn't trying to be Netflix. We're not here to give you every option. We're here to recreate that
            La-Z-Boy feeling. That moment when you sit down, flip through a few channels, and just <em>settle in</em>.
            No browsing. No algorithms predicting what you want. Just good TV, presented the way it should be.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">This is the ultimate guide for couch potatoes.</span> Lean back. Relax.
            Let us do the work. You're not scrolling through a menu—you're flipping through channels.
            You're not making decisions—you're discovering what's on.
        </p>
